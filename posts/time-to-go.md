I recommend using **Common Sense** whenever possible to support time management.

It was nice to learn about having ADHD a couple of years ago. Not because I need the label or an excuse, but so I could find resources to help, including:

- Lists
- List to remind me to check the lists
- Alarms
- Building habits and not putting things off...
